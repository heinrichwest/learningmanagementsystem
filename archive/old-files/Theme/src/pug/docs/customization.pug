	p We recommend you customize your theme styles using the user style files. You can customize the themeâ€™s styles with the following approaches:

	h5.mt-2(data-anchor) Gulp based workflow

	h5.mt-2 
		code _user.scss
	p You can add your own SCSS and override the theme style in the 
		code src/scss/user.scss
		|  file

	h5.mt-2 
		code _user-variables.scss
	p To make broader changes to the design of the theme, such as changing the color scheme or font sizes, use 
		code scss/_user-variables.scss
		| . Any variable from 
		code scss/bootstrap/_variables.scss 
		|  or 
		code scss/custom/_variables.scss
		|  can be overridden with your own value.

	h5.mt-2(data-anchor) If you are not using Gulp based workflow

	h4.mt-2 
		code user.css
	p You can add your own SCSS and override the theme style in the 
		code public/assets/css/user.css
		|  file
